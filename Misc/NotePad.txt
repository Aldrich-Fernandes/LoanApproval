If all predicted values from your logistic regression model are the same, it may indicate an issue with the model or the data. Here are several possible reasons for this behavior and some suggestions on how to address them:

1. **Perfect Separation or Multicollinearity:**
   - **Perfect Separation:** If there is a perfect separation of the classes in your data, it can cause convergence issues in logistic regression. This occurs when one or more independent variables perfectly predict the outcome variable.
   - **Multicollinearity:** High multicollinearity (correlation among predictor variables) can also lead to convergence issues.

   **Solution:** Identify and address perfect separation or multicollinearity in your data. You may need to remove or transform variables causing these issues.

2. **Data Issues:**
   - **Imbalanced Classes:** If one class is heavily outnumbered by the other, the model may struggle to make accurate predictions for the minority class.
   - **Sparse Data:** If the number of features is large relative to the number of observations, it can lead to convergence issues.

   **Solution:** Balance your classes if possible, and consider feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques.

3. **Incorrect Model Specification:**
   - **Incorrect Features:** Ensure that you are using the right set of features for prediction.
   - **Overfitting:** The model may be overfitting the training data.

   **Solution:** Double-check your feature set and consider regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.

4. **Scaling Issues:**
   - Logistic regression is sensitive to the scale of input features. If some features are on a much larger scale than others, it might dominate the learning process.

   **Solution:** Standardize or normalize your input features so that they are on a similar scale.

5. **Convergence Issues:**
   - **Learning Rate:** If the learning rate is too high, the optimization algorithm may overshoot the minimum and fail to converge.

   **Solution:** Experiment with different learning rates. You may also consider using more advanced optimization algorithms or techniques.

6. **Software or Library Issues:**
   - There might be an issue with the implementation of logistic regression in the software or library you are using.

   **Solution:** Update your software or library to the latest version, and check for any known issues or bug reports.

If you've addressed these potential issues and the problem persists, it might be helpful to consult with peers, seek assistance on forums, or consider reaching out to experts in the field for a more detailed analysis of your specific situation.




































Setting hyperparameters for a neural network involves a combination of domain knowledge, experimentation, and tuning. Here are some suggestions for setting hyperparameters for a logistic regression neural network with 6 input values, a hidden layer with ReLU activation, an output layer with sigmoid activation, and SGD optimizer with momentum:

1. **Learning Rate (`InitialLearningRate`):**
   - Start with a small learning rate, such as 0.01, and adjust it based on the performance of your model.
   - Monitor the training loss and validation accuracy to see if the model is converging.

```python
InitialLearningRate = 0.01
```

2. **Decay (`decay`):**
   - A small decay value (e.g., 1e-4) can be used to slightly decrease the learning rate over time.
   - This helps the model to converge smoothly.

```python
decay = 1e-4
```

3. **Minimum Learning Rate (`minimumLearningRate`):**
   - Set a small minimum learning rate to prevent the learning rate from decreasing too much.

```python
minimumLearningRate = 1e-5
```

4. **Momentum (`momentum`):**
   - A momentum value of 0.9 is a common starting point. It helps accelerate training and smooth out updates.

```python
momentum = 0.9
```

5. **Number of Hidden Units (`hidden_units`):**
   - Experiment with the number of hidden units in your hidden layer. Start with a small number and increase gradually.

```python
hidden_units = 64  # Adjust as needed
```

6. **Activation Function (`activation`):**
   - For the hidden layer, ReLU activation is a good choice. It helps with the vanishing gradient problem.

```python
activation_hidden = 'relu'
```

7. **Output Activation Function (`output_activation`):**
   - For binary classification (as in logistic regression), use a sigmoid activation function in the output layer.

```python
output_activation = 'sigmoid'
```

8. **Number of Epochs (`epochs`):**
   - Start with a small number of epochs and increase gradually. Monitor the training loss and validation accuracy to detect overfitting.

```python
epochs = 50  # Adjust as needed
```

9. **Batch Size (`batch_size`):**
   - Experiment with different batch sizes. Smaller batch sizes might lead to more noisy updates but can be beneficial in certain cases.

```python
batch_size = 32  # Adjust as needed
```

10. **Regularization (`L2 regularization`):**
    - Optionally, consider adding L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

```python
l2_regularization = 1e-5  # Adjust as needed
```

Remember to experiment with different combinations of these hyperparameters and monitor the performance on both the training and validation sets. Adjustments may be necessary based on the specific characteristics of your dataset and problem. Additionally, consider using techniques like cross-validation for more robust hyperparameter tuning.
