    add l1 and l2 reguariastion

    UI

    Userinput error handling

Skills:
        OOP
        OOP objects at runtime
        Complex standard algotithms and structures - csv Data handle
    +    List operations
    +    Advanced matrix Operations
        Reclusive Algorithms (calls itself in it's own function - Main)
    ?    Complex user difined Algorithms
        Dynamic generation of objects based on complex user difned use of OOP model (allow user to create sustom NN - eg layers)

    Can ADD though user logging:
        client server model
        Aggregate SQL functions
        Hashing - Sorting and searching


Errors
    float NaN at Accuracy calc
    numbers are treated as categorical in CreateFeatureColumns
    RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in double_scalars --- Sigmoid differential

handle Outliers ... 1.5(IQR) beyond the LB/UB


 -------- Potentailly make it so that it can be used with any csv array
