# Mortgage Egibility Checker (Alevel - NEA)

## Overview

  A mortgage eligibility checker, designed for mortgage officers, which utilizes a logistic regression model within a neural network framework. This model is based on a data file of prior applicants, allowing it to assess application strength effectively. The program also includes features such as model saving/loading, hyper-parameter adjustment, and streamlined data processing, providing an efficient tool for accurate decision-making and application filtering.

## Features:

- Input your financial and personal details through a simple and intuitive user interface.
- Receive instant feedback on your likelihood of loan approval based on advanced machine learning techniques.
- Customize model hyperparameters and training settings to suit your needs.
- Easily load pre-trained models or train new ones for updated predictions.
